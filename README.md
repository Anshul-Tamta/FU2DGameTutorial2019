# Full Unity 2D Game Tutorial 2019

The aim of this tutorial is to have a complete guide from start to publish on the Itch.io platform. 
Many tutorials show how to to a single task and that's great for showing how to do a single section of code but I find this fails to show how all the different sections work together.  
This tutorial is focused on the process from beginning to end. Which may includes rewriting many areas of code to work with new features.
